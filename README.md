A lightweight and easy to use Core Lightning client and plugin framework with zero dependencies, built in TypeScript.

This client covers 100% of the API provided by Core Lightning 0.11.0.

Please note that this is currently a work-in-progress and some types may be incorrect or parts of the response may be missing.

This code was mostly automatically generated from the Core Lightning documentation and is currently being optimized and tested by humans to ensure all types are correct.

If you notice a problem like missing elements in the response type or types being wrong, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

### Building

The generated code can be generated using `deno run --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write src/generate.ts`
