A lightweight and easy to use c-lightning client and plugin framework with zero dependencies, built in TypeScript.

This client covers 100% of the API provided by c-lightning 0.10.2.

Please note that this is currently a work-in-progress and some types may be incorrect or parts of the response may be missing.

This code was mostly automatically generated from th c-lightning documentation and is currently being optimized and tested by humans to ensure all types are correct.

If you notice a problem like missing elements in the response type or types being wrong, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
