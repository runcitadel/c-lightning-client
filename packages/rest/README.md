A client library for the [Core Lightning REST plugin](https://github.com/Ride-The-Lightning/c-lightning-REST).

This definition covers 100% of the API provided by Core Lightning 0.10.2, as well as 100% of the additional methods in version 0.7.0 of the REST plugin.

Please note that this is currently a work-in-progress and some types may be incorrect or parts of the response may be missing.

This code was mostly automatically generated from the Core Lightning documentation and is currently being optimized and tested by humans to ensure all types are correct.

If you notice a problem like missing elements in the response type or types being wrong, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
