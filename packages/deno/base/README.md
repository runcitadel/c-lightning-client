Abstract API definitions for Core Lightning to build your own RPC client.

If you want an easier solution, check out [@core-ln/core](https://npmjs.com/package/@core-ln/core) for communication over Core Lightning's native unix socket
or [@core-ln/rest](https://npmjs.com/package/@core-ln/rest) for use with the [REST plugin](https://github.com/Ride-the-Lightning/c-lightning-REST).

This definition covers 100% of the API provided by Core Lightning 0.11.0.

Please note that this is currently a work-in-progress and some types may be incorrect or parts of the response may be missing.

This code was mostly automatically generated from the Core Lightning documentation and is currently being optimized and tested by humans to ensure all types are correct.

If you notice a problem like missing elements in the response type or types being wrong, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
